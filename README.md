# Building-a-perceptual-map-

I use Amazon.com product review data to build a MDS map. It is 
good for what today’s marketers can do through machine learning and text mining in 
analyzing competitors. The key idea is that a customer’ co-mention of two products can be a 
proxy of the similarity between the products in the customer’s mind.
