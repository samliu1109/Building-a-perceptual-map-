# Building-a-perceptual-map-


I use the appliance dataset from Amazon Reviews online, extracting the 'Range Parts & Accessories' subcategory from the appliance data.

Then, I filter the top 20 brands that have the highest number of counts in the data. I create the perceptual map which projects the multi-dimensional relationship from various brands to a 2-dimensional graph. So, we can see the relationship between each brand more clearly.

After identifying the relationship between each brand, it would e a good indicator to depict and understand how the target customers view and feel about a given brand or product. Therefore, we can better generate marketing strategies.
